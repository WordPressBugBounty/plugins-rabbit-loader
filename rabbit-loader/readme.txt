== Description ==

= 🚀 Load Your Pages Faster & Rank Higher =  
RabbitLoader is an **AI-powered performance enhancement plugin** that makes your WordPress website load in milliseconds and achieve the elusive green score (90+) on PageSpeed Insights — for every page, not just your homepage.  

Unlike traditional plugins that require constant tweaking, RabbitLoader analyzes every asset on your pages — CSS, JS, images, and fonts — and applies the right optimizations automatically.  
The result: faster pages, smoother experiences, and less time spent on manual performance tuning.  

Built and tested with all major WordPress themes and builders (including Elementor, Divi, and others) — so you get the speed without the stress.

= 💡 How RabbitLoader Improves SEO & User Experience =  
RabbitLoader’s AI optimizations directly improve how people interact with your site — and the results are backed by real data:  

* **Faster Loads** – Pages load in under 1 second, reducing bounce rate by up to **50%**.  
* **Stable Visual Layouts** – Critical CSS prevents shifts; stable pages see **24% higher engagement**.  
* **Higher PSI Scores** – Hit **90+ on PageSpeed Insights** for all pages with one plugin.  
* **Pass Core Web Vitals** – Tuned for perfect LCP, CLS, and INP. Passing sites are **24% less likely to lose rankings**.  
* **SEO & Conversion Gains** – A 1s improvement can boost conversions by **7%**.

= 🔄 What RabbitLoader Replaces (All-in-One vs Many) =  
Most sites rely on 5–6 different tools: one for caching, one for images, one for CSS/JS, plus a CDN plugin. That means:  
❌ Too many plugins to manage  
❌ Higher conflict risk  
❌ Extra cost and wasted time  

RabbitLoader replaces them all:  

* Image Optimization – WebP/AVIF conversion, resizing, lazy-load.  
* Critical CSS Generation – Per-page Critical CSS for faster first paint.  
* Smart JS Deferral – Improves responsiveness without breaking layouts.  
* Global CDN with Edge Caching – Worldwide low-latency delivery.  
* Lazy Loading – Images and iframes load only when needed.  
* Minification & Compression – HTML/CSS/JS minified with Brotli/Gzip.  
* PageSpeed Monitoring – Built-in and included.  

👉 **One Plugin. Less Hassle. More Speed.**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will RabbitLoader break my design or WooCommerce? =  
No. RabbitLoader’s AI-powered safe defaults are tested with popular themes and builders. Cart, checkout, and logged-in pages are excluded from caching by default. You can exclude any page or roll back changes anytime.  

= How long do you need to optimize a website? =
The improvement of the speed would reflect instantly after installing the plugin.
We start by optimizing your home page & you can see the difference in PageSpeed score immediately on Google PSI or the RabbitLoader console after installation.
Optimization time for the entire website depends on the number of pages; on average a medium size website takes around 15 minutes to optimize and cache your website’s contents
= What score would I achieve on the PageSeed Insights test? =
Most websites using RabbitLoader reach an average PageSpeed score of over 90 for most of their web pages.
Home pages usually score lower than other pages on your website as it usually contains sliders and other heavy graphics and scripts. 
If you have Ads or analytics running on your pages you can either choose to run those scripts first which would lower your score or you can delay them & improve the score further.
Some pages on your website might even score a perfect 100 with RabbitLoader.

Yes. Critical CSS improves LCP, layout refinements reduce CLS, and smart JavaScript delay boosts INP — especially for mobile users.
